# âBLOCKED EXPLOIT: SQL Injection Attempt (Tool/Network Obstruction)

## ðGoal
Bypass the application login using a classic SQL Injection payload (`' OR 1=1 --`) targeting the email parameter, aiming for a Broken Authentication (A07) finding.

## ðMethodology and Obstacles
The intended methodology involved intercepting the login API request using **Burp Suite** and modifying the JSON payload in the Repeater tab.

### Key Obstacles Encountered
1.  **Proxy Failure:** Burp Suite failed to consistently intercept the target `POST /rest/user/login` request, instead catching a high volume of background traffic.
2.  **Connection Instability:** The local OWASP Juice Shop environment and the proxy chain experienced intermittent connection failures, leading to repeated resets and poor application responsiveness.
3.  **Tool Dependency:** The complexity of setting up the proxy and handling the application's asynchronous background requests made successful manual exploitation in the Repeater tab impractical under current environmental constraints.

## ðConclusion and Pivot

### Finding
The SQL Injection attack was inconclusive due to technical and environmental failures, not application-level defense. The application's defenses against the payload could not be fully tested.

### Action Taken
The Red Team pivoted immediately to a tool-free, browser-based exploit (**Reflected XSS**) to maintain momentum and ensure learning objectives were met without further environmental delays.

### Future Plan
The SQL Injection challenge will be revisited when a dedicated, stable environment (e.g., a fresh container instance or a stable virtual machine) is available for effective use of proxy-based tools like Burp Suite.
